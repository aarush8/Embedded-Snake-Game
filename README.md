A classic Snake game implemented on custom hardware, featuring an mbed microcontroller, a breadboard for circuit prototyping, a navigation switch for control, and an LCD screen for display. This project demonstrates embedded programming and hardware interfacing for a retro gaming experience.

## Features

*   Classic Snake gameplay on a custom hardware setup.
*   Control the snake's movement using a navigation switch (up, down, left, right).
*   Game display rendered on an LCD screen.
*   Implemented on an mbed microcontroller, showcasing embedded system development.
*   Modular code structure for easy understanding and modification.

## Hardware Requirements

To build and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

*   **mbed Microcontroller:** (e.g., mbed LPC1768, mbed NXP LPC1768)
*   **Breadboard:** For assembling the circuit.
*   **LCD Screen:** (e.g., 16x2 or 20x4 character LCD, or a graphical LCD if preferred and code adjusted)
*   **Navigation Switch:** A 5-way tactile switch (up, down, left, right, select/push).
*   **Resistors:** (e.g., for LCD contrast, switch pull-ups if needed)
*   **Jumper Wires:** For making connections on the breadboard.
*   **USB Cable:** To power and program the mbed.

## Software Requirements

*   **mbed CLI or mbed Online Compiler:** To compile and flash the code to your mbed microcontroller.
*   **mbed OS (or mbed Classic if compatible with your board):** The framework used for development.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mbed-Snake.git
    cd mbed-Snake
    ```

2.  **Hardware Assembly:**
    *   Connect your LCD screen to the mbed. Refer to the specific LCD's datasheet and mbed's pinout for correct connections (e.g., RS, E, D4-D7, VCC, GND).
    *   Connect the navigation switch to digital input pins on the mbed. Ensure you have appropriate pull-up or pull-down resistors if necessary.
    *   Connect all components to the breadboard and mbed's power and ground rails.

3.  **Compile and Flash (using mbed CLI):**
    *   Initialize the mbed project:
        ```bash
        mbed deploy
        mbed target <YOUR_MBED_BOARD_NAME> # e.g., NUCLEO_F401RE
        mbed toolchain GCC_ARM
        ```
    *   Compile the code:
        ```bash
        mbed compile
        ```
    *   Drag and drop the generated `.bin` file onto your mbed drive when connected via USB, or use `mbed flash` if configured.

## Usage

Once the code is successfully flashed to your mbed microcontroller and the hardware is correctly assembled:

1.  **Power On:** Connect your mbed to a power source (typically via USB to your computer).
2.  **Start Game:** The game should automatically start on the LCD.
3.  **Control:** Use the navigation switch to steer the snake.
    *   **Up/Down/Left/Right:** Change the snake's direction.
    *   (Optional: If you've implemented a pause/start button, use the center click of the nav switch for that).
4.  **Objective:** Guide the snake to eat the food pellets without hitting the walls or its own tail.
